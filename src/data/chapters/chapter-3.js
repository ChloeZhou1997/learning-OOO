<p>With the foundational pillars of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism established, we can now explore the more nuanced mechanisms that bring sophisticated object-oriented designs to life. This chapter moves beyond <em>what</em> objects are and delves into <em>how</em> they are constructed, composed, and contractually obligated to behave.</p>

<h2>1. The Constructor: An Object's Birth Certificate</h2>
<p>In Chapter 1, we learned that a class is a blueprint and an object is an instance created from that blueprint. But how, exactly, is an object "born"? What ensures it is created in a valid and usable state? This is the role of the <strong>constructor</strong>.</p>
<p>A constructor is a special method within a class that is automatically called when a new object of that class is created (a process called <em>instantiation</em>). Its primary responsibility is to initialize the object's attributes, ensuring the object starts its life in a consistent and predictable state.</p>
<p>Consider a <code>Book</code> class. A book object would be meaningless without a title or an author. A constructor enforces this rule.</p>
<p>In OO languages, constructors are methods that share the same name as the class and have no return type. For example, a constructor for the Cabbie class would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>public Cabbie(){
    /* code to construct the object */
}</code></pre>
<p>The compiler will recognize that the method name is identical to the class name and consider the method a constructor.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Caution:</strong> Note that a constructor does not have a return value. If you provide a return value, the compiler will not treat the method as a constructor.</blockquote>

<h3>When Is a Constructor Called?</h3>
<p>When a new object is created, one of the first things that happens is that the constructor is called. Check out the following code:</p>
<pre><code>Cabbie myCabbie = new Cabbie();</code></pre>
<p>The new keyword creates a new instance of the Cabbie class, thus allocating the required memory. Then the constructor itself is called, passing the arguments in the parameter list.</p>

<h3>The Default Constructor</h3>
<p>If you write a class and do not include a constructor, the class will still compile, and you can still use it. If the class provides no explicit constructor, a default constructor will be provided. It is important to understand that at least one constructor always exists, regardless of whether you write a constructor yourself.</p>
<p>Besides the creation of the object itself, the only action that a default constructor takes is to call the constructor of its superclass. If you do not provide a constructor for the Cabbie class, the following default constructor is inserted:</p>
<pre><code>public Cabbie(){
    super();
}</code></pre>
<blockquote><strong>Providing a Constructor:</strong> The rule of thumb is that you should always provide a constructor, even if you do not plan on doing anything inside it. It is good programming practice to always include at least one constructor in a class.</blockquote>

<h3>Using Multiple Constructors</h3>
<p>In many cases, an object can be constructed in more than one way. To accommodate this situation, you need to provide more than one constructor. For example, let's consider the Count class:</p>
<pre><code>public class Count {
    int count;
    public Count(){
        count = 0;
    }
    public Count (int number){
        count = number;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This is called overloading a method. Overloading allows a programmer to use the same method name over and over, as long as the signature of the method is different each time. The signature consists of the method name and a parameter list.</p>

<h3>How the Superclass Is Constructed</h3>
<p>When using inheritance, you must know how the parent class is constructed. After the new keyword is encountered and the object is allocated, the following steps occur:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first thing that happens inside the constructor is that the constructor of the class's superclass is called. If there is no explicit call to the superclass constructor, the default is called automatically.</li>
<li>Then each class attribute of the object is initialized. These are the attributes that are part of the class definition (instance variables), not the attributes inside the constructor or any other method (local variables).</li>
<li>Then the rest of the code in the constructor executes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>2. Composition vs. Inheritance: Building Relationships</h2>
<p>Two primary ways to build classes from other classes are inheritance and composition. Making the right choice between them is a critical architectural decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inheritance (is-a):</strong> Use when one class is a specialized version of another. A <code>Manager</code> is an <code>Employee</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Composition (has-a):</strong> Use when one class contains or uses another. A <code>Car</code> has an <code>Engine</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The principle "favor composition over inheritance" exists because composition provides more flexibility—you can change the relationships at runtime.</p>

<h2>3. Interfaces vs. Abstract Classes</h2>
<p>Both interfaces and abstract classes define contracts, but they serve different purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> A pure contract that defines what methods a class must implement, with no implementation details.</li>
<li><strong>Abstract Class:</strong> Can provide both abstract methods (no implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation). Use when you want to share code among several closely related classes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. The Challenge of Multiple Inheritance</h2>
<p>Multiple inheritance—where a class inherits from more than one parent class—can lead to ambiguity. The famous "Diamond Problem" occurs when a class inherits from two classes that share a common ancestor. Many modern languages (Java, C#) avoid this by allowing multiple interface implementation but only single class inheritance.</p>
<p>As the name implies, multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one class. In practice, this seems like a great idea. However, multiple inheritance can significantly increase the complexity of a system, both for the programmer and the compiler writers.</p>
<p>The designers of Java and .NET decided that the increased complexity of allowing multiple inheritance far outweighed its advantages, so they eliminated it from the language. In some ways, the Java and .NET language construct of interfaces compensates for this.</p>

<h2>5. Error Handling</h2>
<p>It is rare for a class to be written perfectly the first time. In most, if not all, situations, things will go wrong. Any developer who does not plan for problems is courting danger.</p>
<p>Assuming that your code has the ability to detect and trap an error condition, you can handle the error in several different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore the problem—not a good idea!</li>
<li>Check for potential problems and abort the program when you find a problem.</li>
<li>Check for potential problems, catch the mistake, and attempt to fix the problem.</li>
<li>Throw an exception. (Often this is the preferred way to handle the situation.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Throwing an Exception</h3>
<p>Most OO languages provide a feature called exceptions. In the most basic sense, exceptions are unexpected events that occur within a system. Exceptions provide a way to detect problems and then handle them. In Java, C# and C++, exceptions are handled by the keywords catch and throw.</p>
<p>Here is the structure for a try/catch block:</p>
<pre><code>try {
    // possible nasty code
} catch (Exception e) {
    // code to handle the exception
}</code></pre>
<p>If an exception is thrown within the try block, the catch block will handle it. Here is an example of how an exception is caught in Java:</p>
<pre><code>try {
    // possible nasty code
    count = 0;
    count = 5/count;
} catch(ArithmeticException e) {
    // code to handle the exception
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
    count = 1;
}
System.out.println("The exception is handled.");</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the division by zero within the try block will cause an arithmetic exception. Because the exception was thrown within a try block, the catch block is checked to see whether the specific exception was planned for.</p>

<h2>6. The Concept of Scope</h2>
<p>Multiple objects can be instantiated from a single class. Each of these objects has a unique identity and state. However, some attributes and methods may, if properly declared, be shared by all the objects instantiated from the same class.</p>
<p>Methods represent the behaviors of an object; the state of the object is represented by attributes. There are three types of attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local attributes</li>
<li>Object attributes</li>
<li>Class attributes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Local Attributes</h3>
<p>Local attributes are owned by a specific method. Consider the following code:</p>
<pre><code>public class Number {
    public method1() {
        int count;
    }
    public method2() {
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The method method1 contains a local variable called count. This integer is accessible only inside method1. The method method2 has no idea that the integer count even exists.</p>
<p>Attributes (and methods) exist within a particular scope. In Java, C#, and C++, scope is delineated by curly braces ({}).</p>

<h3>Object Attributes</h3>
<p>There are many design situations in which an attribute must be shared by several methods within the same object:</p>
<pre><code>public class Number {
    int count; // available to both method1 and method2
    public method1() {
        count = 1;
    }
    public method2() {
        count = 2;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the class attribute count is declared outside the scope of both method1 and method2. However, it is within the scope of the class. Thus, count is available to both methods. There is only one copy of count for the entire object, but this copy is not shared between different objects.</p>

<h3>Class Attributes</h3>
<p>It is possible for two or more objects to share attributes. In Java, C#, and C++, you do this by making the attribute static:</p>
<pre><code>public class Number {
    static int count;
    public method1() {
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>By declaring count as static, this attribute is allocated a single piece of memory for all objects instantiated from the class. Thus, all objects of the class use the same memory location for count. This is about as close to global data as we get in OO design.</p>

<h2>7. Operator Overloading</h2>
<p>Some OO languages allow you to overload an operator. C++ is an example of one such language. Operator overloading allows you to change the meaning of an operator. For example, when most people see a plus sign, they assume it represents addition.</p>
<p>However, there are times when a plus sign could represent something else. For example, in the following code:</p>
<pre><code>String firstName = "Joe", lastName = "Smith";
String Name = firstName + " " + lastName;</code></pre>
<p>You would expect that Name would contain "Joe Smith". The plus sign here has been overloaded to perform string concatenation.</p>
<p>More recent OO languages like Java and .NET do not allow operator overloading. The designers of Java must have decided that operator overloading was more of a problem than it was worth.</p>

<h2>8. Object Operations</h2>
<p>Some of the most basic operations in programming become more complicated when you're dealing with complex data structures and objects. For example, when you want to copy or compare primitive data types, the process is quite straightforward. However, copying and comparing objects is not quite as simple.</p>

<h3>Deep Versus Shallow Copies</h3>
<p>A deep copy is when all the references are followed and new copies are created for all referenced objects. There might be many levels involved in a deep copy. For objects with references to many objects, which in turn might have references to even more objects, the copy itself can create significant overhead.</p>
<p>A shallow copy would simply copy the reference and not follow the levels. If you just do a simple copy of the object (called a bitwise copy), any object that the primary object references will not be copied—only the references will be copied. Thus, both objects (the original and the copy) will point to the same objects.</p>
<p>This problem also manifests itself when comparing objects. Because objects contain references, these reference trees must be followed to do a valid comparison of objects.</p>
