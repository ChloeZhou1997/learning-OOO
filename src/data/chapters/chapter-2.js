<h2>The Paradigm Shift</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter, we introduced the three pillars of object-oriented programming: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Knowing their definitions is the first step. The next, and most crucial, step is to fundamentally change <em>how you think</em> about a problem. This is the paradigm shift.</p>
<p>Many experienced programmers, particularly those from a procedural background (like C or early versions of Visual Basic), struggle with object-oriented development. It's not because the languages are difficult, but because they continue to write procedural code using an object-oriented language. They haven't made the mental leap.</p>
<blockquote>"Many times developers who claim to be C++ programmers are simply C programmers using C++ compilers."</blockquote>
<p>This chapter is dedicated to making that leap. Our goal is to move from viewing programming as a linear sequence of tasks to seeing it as a dynamic system of interacting, autonomous objects.</p>

<h2>1. Viewing the World as Objects, Not Scripts</h2>
<p>Let's begin by contrasting the two ways of thinking.</p>

<h3>The Procedural Mindset</h3>
<p>Procedural programming is like following a recipe. It's a top-down, linear sequence of instructions. Consider a simple graphics rendering process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clear the screen buffer.</li>
<li>Read the first shape coordinates from an array.</li>
<li>Calculate the pixel positions for that shape.</li>
<li>Draw the pixels to the screen buffer.</li>
<li>Read the next shape coordinates.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3-5 until all shapes are drawn.</li>
<li>Display the buffer on screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>The focus is entirely on the <em>actions</em> to be performed. The data (shape coordinates) is passive; it's just stuff that the procedures act upon.</p>

<h3>The Object-Oriented View</h3>
<p>Object-oriented thinking flips this script. Instead of focusing on the verbs (the actions), we first focus on the nouns (the entities). What are the "things" in our graphics system?</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Shape</strong> (abstract concept)</li>
<li>Specific shapes like <strong>Circle</strong>, <strong>Rectangle</strong>, <strong>Triangle</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>Canvas</strong> or <strong>DrawingArea</strong></li>
<li>Perhaps a <strong>Renderer</strong> or <strong>GraphicsContext</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In this model, we don't have a master script that controls everything. Instead, we have objects that have their own data and their own responsibilities.</p>
<p>A <code>Circle</code> object isn't just a passive set of coordinates. It's an active entity that <em>knows</em> its own properties, such as its center point and radius. It also has behaviors, like the ability to <code>draw()</code> itself or <code>calculateArea()</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Canvas</code> object's job is not to know how to draw every possible shape, but to manage the drawing surface. It might ask each <code>Shape</code> object, "Draw yourself on me," and each shape knows how to render itself. The canvas orchestrates the interaction, but the core drawing logic resides within the objects that are most responsible for it.</p>

<h2>2. Abstraction: The Art of Ignoring the Details</h2>
<p>How do we decide what "things" should become objects and what information they should contain? The answer is <strong>abstraction</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is the process of identifying the essential characteristics of an object and filtering out the rest. It's about focusing on what an object <em>is</em> and <em>does</em> at a high level, while ignoring the irrelevant, low-level details of how it works.</p>
<p>Consider a real-world example: a car. When you are driving a car, you are interacting with its abstraction:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> Steering wheel, pedals, gear shift.</li>
<li><strong>Essential Characteristics:</strong> It can accelerate, brake, and turn.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't need to know the specifics of the internal combustion process, the firing order of the spark plugs, or the hydraulic pressure in the brake lines. Those are <em>implementation details</em>. The car's designers have abstracted them away, providing you with a simple interface to accomplish your goal (driving).</p>
<p>In software, when we design a <code>Shape</code> class for a graphics system, we apply the same thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Essential for Graphics:</strong> <code>position</code>, <code>color</code>, <code>size</code>, methods like <code>draw()</code>, <code>move()</code>, <code>rotate()</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Irrelevant for Graphics:</strong> <code>creationDate</code>, <code>author</code>, <code>fileFormat</code> (unless we're building a drawing application with metadata).</li>
</ul>
<p>Abstraction is the key to managing complexity. By hiding unnecessary detail, we make our systems easier to design, understand, and maintain.</p>

<h2>3. The Power of Separation: Interface vs. Implementation</h2>
<p>A direct result of good abstraction is the clean separation of an object's interface from its implementation. This is one of the most powerful concepts in object-oriented design.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> <em>What</em> an object can do. This is its public face, the set of methods and properties it exposes to the outside world. It is the contract that the object promises to uphold.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation:</strong> <em>How</em> the object does it. This is the private, internal logic and data that fulfills the promise of the interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's revisit the perfect real-world analogy: the electrical outlet. The wall socket is a standardized <strong>interface</strong>. Any appliance that conforms to this interface (i.e., has a compatible plug) can get power. The appliance (the "user" of the interface) has no knowledge of the <strong>implementation</strong>. The power could be coming from a coal plant, a nuclear reactor, or a solar farm. If the power company upgrades from coal to solar, the implementation changes, but the interface remains the same. Your toaster still works without any changes.</p>
<p>This is the holy grail of software design: the ability to improve or fix the internal workings of a component without breaking the code that uses it.</p>

<h2>4. An Interface/Implementation Example</h2>
<p>Let's create a simple data structure class - a Stack. We'll write some Java code that implements a stack data structure. As we've discussed, knowing your end users is always the most important issue when doing any kind of design. You should do some analysis of the situation and conduct interviews with end users, and then list the requirements for the project. The following are some requirements we might want to use for the stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>We must be able to push an item onto the stack.</li>
<li>We must be able to pop an item off the stack.</li>
<li>We must be able to peek at the top item without removing it.</li>
<li>We must be able to check if the stack is empty.</li>
<li>We must be able to get the current size of the stack.</li>
<li>We must be able to clear all items from the stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these requirements in mind, we can make an initial attempt to design the Stack class by creating possible interfaces for these end users.</p>
<p>In this case, the Stack class is intended for programmers who need a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure. Thus, the interface is essentially the application-programming interface (API) that the programmer will use. These methods are, in effect, wrappers that enclose the functionality of the underlying data storage mechanism.</p>
<p>For each of the requirements we listed, we need a corresponding method that provides the functionality we want. Now you need to ask a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>To effectively use this class, do you, as a programmer, need to know anything else about it?</li>
<li>Do you need to know whether the stack uses an array or a linked list internally?</li>
<li>Do you need to know how the stack manages memory allocation?</li>
<li>Do you need to know the specific algorithm used to resize the internal storage?</li>
</ul>
<p>On all counts the answer is a resounding no! You don't need to know any of this information. All you care about is that you get the proper return values and that the operations are performed correctly.</p>
<p>What would the code for this public interface look like? Let's look at the push() method:</p>
<pre><code>public void push(Object item) {
    /* Some bounds checking */
    /* Add item to internal array */
    /* Update size counter */
};</code></pre>
<p>In this case, you realize that the push method requires an Object as a parameter. That's all we need to know. Now comes the fun stuffâ€”what really makes interfaces so great!</p>
<p>Let's say we initially implemented our Stack using an array. But we discovered performance issues with frequent resizing. So we change the implementation to use a linked list instead. Now the code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>public void push(Object item){
    /* Create new node */
    /* Link node to existing list */
    /* Update head pointer */
};</code></pre>
<p>To our great satisfaction, not one user of our Stack class complained or even noticed. This is because even though the implementation changed dramatically (from array to linked list), the interface did not! As far as the user is concerned, the calls are still the same. The code change for the implementation might have required quite a bit of work, but not one line of application code that uses this Stack class needed to change.</p>
<p>By separating the user interface from the implementation, we can save a lot of headaches down the road. The internal data structure is transparent to the end users, who see only the interface.</p>

<h2>5. Using Abstract Thinking When Designing Interfaces</h2>
<p>One of the main advantages of OO programming is that classes can be reused. In general, reusable classes tend to have interfaces that are more abstract than concrete. Concrete interfaces tend to be very specific, whereas abstract interfaces are more general. However, simply stating that a highly abstract interface is more useful than a highly concrete interface, although often true, is not always the case.</p>
<p>It is possible to write a very useful, concrete class that is not at all reusable. This happens all the time, and there is nothing wrong with it in some situations. However, we are now in the design business, and want to take advantage of what OO offers us. So our goal is to design abstract, highly reusable classesâ€”and to do this we will design highly abstract user interfaces.</p>
<p>To illustrate the difference between an abstract and a concrete interface, let's create a sorting algorithm object. It is much more useful to have an interface such as "sort this collection" than to have separate interfaces such as "compare element 0 with element 1," "swap positions," "partition array," and so on because all the user wants to do is get a sorted collection.</p>
<p>When you have an unsorted list of items and need them in order, you invoke a sorting method. The method asks, "What collection do you want sorted?" You provide the collection. You might not even know which sorting algorithm is best for your data, and even if you did, you wouldn't want to manually orchestrate every comparison and swap. How the sorter implements the actual sorting is of no concern to you, the user.</p>
<p>Now, where does the connection between abstract and reuse come in? Ask yourself which of these two scenarios is more reusable, the abstract or the not-so-abstract? To put it more simply, which interface is more reusable: "sort(myList)," or "compare(0,1), swap(0,1), compare(1,2), swap(1,2)..."? Obviously, the first interface is more reusable. You can use it with any collection type, with any data that can be compared. The second approach only works for a specific arrangement of data. Thus, the abstract interface "sort" is generally the way to go for a good, reusable OO design whose implementation might use quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort depending on the data characteristics.</p>

<h2>6. Giving the User the Minimal Interface Possible</h2>
<p>When designing a class, the rule of thumb is to always provide the user with as little knowledge of the inner workings of the class as possible. To accomplish this, follow these simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give the users only what they absolutely need. In effect, this means the class has as few interfaces as possible. When you start designing a class, start with a minimal interface. The design of a class is iterative, so you will soon discover that the minimal set of interfaces might not suffice. This is fine. It is better to have to add interfaces because users really need it than to give the users more interfaces than they need.</li>
<li>Public interfaces define what the users can access. If you initially hide the entire class from the user by making the interfaces private, when programmers start using the class, you will be forced to make certain methods publicâ€”these methods thus become the public interface.</li>
<li>It is vital to design classes from a user's perspective and not from an information systems viewpoint. Too often designers of classes design the class to make it fit into a specific technological model. Make sure when you are designing a class that you go over the requirements and the design with the people who will actually use itâ€”not just developers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Determining the Users</h3>
<p>Let's look at a GUI button component example. We have already decided that the users are the ones who will actually use the system. This said, the obvious question is who are the users?</p>
<p>The first impulse is to say the end users clicking the button. This is only partially correct. Although the end users certainly interact with the button, the programmer using the button component must be able to successfully integrate it into their application. Additionally, the GUI framework itself might need to interact with the button for rendering and event handling. In other words, providing an interface that only considers the clicker, like "doSomething()," without considering how programmers need to configure the button (setText, setEnabled, addClickListener) would create an unusable component.</p>
<p>For a software analogy, consider that end users might want a button to perform magic, but the programmer needs realistic interfaces to set up the button's behavior, appearance, and event handling.</p>
<p>In short, any object that sends a message to the button object is considered a user (and yes, the users are objects, too). This includes the application code, the event system, and the rendering engine.</p>

<h3>Object Behavior</h3>
<p>Identifying the users is only a part of the exercise. After the users are identified, you must determine the behaviors of the objects. From the viewpoint of all the users, begin identifying the purpose of each object and what it must do to perform properly. Note that many of the initial choices will not survive the final cut of the public interface. These choices are identified by gathering requirements using various methods such as UML Use Cases.</p>

<h3>Environmental Constraints</h3>
<p>The environment often imposes limitations on what an object can do. In fact, environmental constraints are almost always a factor. Computer hardware might limit software functionality. For example, a system might not be connected to a network, or a company might use a specific type of printer. In the taxi example, the cab cannot drive on a road if a bridge is out, even if it provides a quicker way to the airport.</p>

<h3>Identifying the Public Interfaces</h3>
<p>With all the information gathered about the users, the object behaviors, and the environment, you need to determine the public interfaces for each user object. So think about how you would use a Queue data structure object:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add an item to the back of the queue (enqueue).</li>
<li>Remove an item from the front of the queue (dequeue).</li>
<li>Check if the queue is empty.</li>
<li>Look at the front item without removing it (peek).</li>
<li>Get the current size of the queue.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you need to provide to use the queue object?</p>
<ul>
<li>Items to store in the queue.</li>
<li>Possibly a capacity limit (for bounded queues).</li>
<li>Perhaps a comparison function (for priority queues).</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially, you think about how the object is used and not how it is built. You might discover that the object needs more interfaces, such as "clear()" to empty the queue or "toArray()" to get all elements.</p>
<p>As is always the case, nailing down the final interface is an iterative process. For each interface, you must determine whether the interface contributes to the operation of the object. If it does not, perhaps it is not necessary. Many OO texts recommend that each interface model only one behavior.</p>

<h3>Identifying the Implementation</h3>
<p>After the public interfaces are chosen, you need to identify the implementation. After the class is designed and all the methods required to operate the class properly are in place, the specifics of how to get the class to work are considered.</p>
<p>Technically, anything that is not a public interface can be considered the implementation. This means that the user will never see any of the methods that are considered part of the implementation, including the method's signature (which includes the name of the method and the parameter list), as well as the actual code inside the method.</p>
<p>It is possible to have a private method that is used internally by the class. Any private method is considered part of the implementation given that the user will never see it and thus will not have access to it. For example, a class may have a changePassword() method; however, the same class may have a private method that actually encrypts the password. This method would be hidden from the user and called only from inside the changePassword() method.</p>
<p>The implementation is totally hidden from the user. The code within public methods is actually a part of the implementation because the user cannot see it. (The user should only see the calling structure of an interfaceâ€”not the code inside it.)</p>
<p>This means that, theoretically, anything that is considered the implementation might change without affecting how the user interfaces with the class. This assumes, of course, that the implementation is providing the answers the user expects.</p>
<p>Whereas the interface represents how the user sees the object, the implementation is really the nuts and bolts of the object. The implementation contains the code that represents the state of an object.</p>
