<p>Moving from individual class design to system design requires a different set of skills. This chapter teaches you how to transform requirements into a working object model through systematic analysis and design techniques.</p>

<h2>1. Requirements Gathering</h2>
<p>Before writing any code, you must understand what the system needs to do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functional Requirements:</strong> What the system must do</li>
<li><strong>Non-functional Requirements:</strong> How well it must do it (performance, security, usability)</li>
<li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Limitations on the solution (budget, technology, time)</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. CRC Cards: A Simple but Powerful Tool</h2>
<p><strong>Class-Responsibility-Collaboration (CRC)</strong> cards help you discover the objects in your system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Class:</strong> The name of the object</li>
<li><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> What the object knows and does</li>
<li><strong>Collaborations:</strong> Other objects it works with</li>
</ul>
<p>Physical index cards work bestâ€”they're tangible, easy to rearrange, and encourage group participation.</p>

<h2>3. From Requirements to Objects</h2>
<p>A systematic approach to object discovery:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify the nouns:</strong> These become candidate classes</li>
<li><strong>Identify the verbs:</strong> These become methods</li>
<li><strong>Group related concepts:</strong> Look for natural associations</li>
<li><strong>Assign responsibilities:</strong> Each class should have a clear purpose</li>
</ol>

<h2>4. Prototyping</h2>
<p>Prototypes help validate your design before full implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UI Mockups:</strong> Show how users will interact with the system</li>
<li><strong>Proof of Concept:</strong> Test technical feasibility</li>
<li><strong>Evolutionary Prototypes:</strong> Start simple and refine iteratively</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Case Study: Designing a Blackjack Game</h2>
<p>Let's apply these techniques to design a blackjack game:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Players vs dealer, standard rules, betting system</li>
<li><strong>Identified Objects:</strong> Game, Player, Dealer, Deck, Card, Hand</li>
<li><strong>Key Collaborations:</strong> Game manages Players and Dealer, Dealer manages Deck, Players have Hands</li>
</ol>
